Assignment details
The following real-world problem needs to be solved as a small programming exercise.

Queensland State hosts the Queensland Idol competition each summer during the state fair. The talent competition takes place over a three-day period during which contestants are eliminated following rounds of performances until the year’s ultimate winner is chosen.

This program named QueenslandCompetitionApp performs/allows the following:

Displays the number of tickets for adults, for children and for seniors and displays a statement that shows a statistic of visitors attending.
If the number of adult tickets is smaller than or equal to the total of children's and senior tickets, the app displays “The competition is becoming a festival for everyone!”.
If the number of children's tickets is greater than or equal to senior tickets, the app should display “The competition is attracting more and more young people!”.
In other cases, the app displays “The competition should have more space for kids!”.


The app is developed using simple logic.

The code can be tested using test data covering multiple cases.

The program is free from any compilations/execution errors.
